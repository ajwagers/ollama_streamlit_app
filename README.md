# Ollama Streamlit App
I am building a streamlit interface for ollama and including RAG and Agent functionality.

v0 - This is a simple but functional webapp that allows you to chat with the LLM but has very little other features.
v0.1 - reworks some features and allows the user to select a model from their local Ollama instance.  Still skimpy on features.
